"""Exceptions raised by the ShotGrid client.

Callers import these directly (`from core.shotgrid import ShotGridNotFound`)
and catch them by type.  The string forms are production-facing: they describe
the problem in the pipeline's own terms and never leak `shotgun_api3` internals.

When a ShotGrid write fails, the underlying `shotgun_api3.Fault` is wrapped
in `ShotGridWriteError` and attached to `__cause__` so developers
still see the original traceback while artists see only a clean message.

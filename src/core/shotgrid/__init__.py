"""ShotGrid integration — single-import surface for every pipeline caller.

The `ShotGrid` connection class lives in `pipe.shotgrid.client`; the
entity types in `pipe.shotgrid.entities`; the path helpers in
`pipe.shotgrid.paths`; the exception hierarchy in
`pipe.shotgrid.errors`.  Callers should reach for everything via this
package: `from core.shotgrid import ShotGrid, Asset, ShotGridNotFound, ...`.
